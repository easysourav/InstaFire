InstaFire: Android Instagram Clone with Firebase

I built a basic Android Instagram app clone using Firebase, written in Kotlin. My app allows the user to sign in and create posts with an image and description. 
I used Firebase, an app development platform developed by Google, to power my application. 
I used various Firebase services such as Authentication, Storage, and Firestore to build my app.

Here is link for demo of my app: https://youtu.be/s5Egqvrhem8
